    "description": "The orchard is the base for a social project. Focused on the neighborhood and people who live in a vulnerable setting. In doing so, they learn about alternative forms of farming, gardening and economic (re-)distribution oriented to inclusion and care-taking. The site is an experimental setting to create new commons and cultivate regenerative practices. As a \u2018brugboer\u2019, Bart wants above all to create a setting where people can connect with each other in a safe way. In particular it offers a safe space for adolescents at risk of homelessness and social/financial exclusion. This in collaboration with a social restaurant in the neighbourhood of Brugse Poort\r\n\r\ninfobrugboerbart.txt\r\n\r\nMeer info\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/brugboer",
